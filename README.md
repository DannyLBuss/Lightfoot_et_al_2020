# Lightfoot_et_al_2020 - The Effect of Endemic Warfare on Diet in Ottoman period Croatia: An Isotopic Approach

##Appendix 3 
###This repository contains the code used to perform the mcmcGLMM analyses demonstrated in the publication titled by >The Effect of Endemic Warfare on Diet in Ottoman period Croatia: An Isotopic Approach
- The word document contains summary tables, model outputs, mcmcGLMM traceplots and sensitivity analyses (e.g. with and without Sisak)
- The R script contains example code for one isotope used to run the mixed-effect models including the null model

###Running mcmcGLMM analyses - code checklist
- [x] Tidy up model code
- [x] Upload traceplots
- [ ] Upload posterior distributions for each model
- [ ] Finalise and upload DIC summary tables
- [ ] Provide prior information and explain in sufficient detail
